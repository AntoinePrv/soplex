	Added member function 'LPRowset::setType()'
	due to Roland Wessaely

TK 13OCT98 sorter.hh
	Deleted template 'sort( T* t, int n )' because some

	for better 64-bit compatibility
	due to Tobias Polzin

TK 13OCT98 dataset.hh

	spxdefaultpr.cc spxsteeppr.cc spxweightpr.cc spxweightst.cc
	unused variables deleted.

TK20OCT98 spxlp.hh spxbasis.hh spxscale.hh spxgeneralsm.hh
	added virtual destructor.

        with data after column 70 and none in field 6 let the program
	crash.

TK02NOV98 svector.cc svector.hh
	Made SVector::operator* inline for better performance.

TK04NOV98 example.cc
	It's now possible to set the pricer and ratiotest from
	the commandline. Switches are -p[0-5] and -t[0.2].

TK04NOV98 spxweightpr.cc
	Marked an bug in the calculation. 
	Unfortuately I have no idea how to remove the bug.

TK10NOV98 soplex.hh
	Striped SoPlex:: in the declaration of the default constructor.

TK08DEC98 spxmps.cc
        Change ' ' to isspace in getField. This makes the MPS Reader

        Removed bug and improved memory handling.
        due to Steffen Hansen.

        rowstat, colstat, stat and costat and eleminated a bunch
        of wild casts. 

TK22Apr01 dataset.hh
        Function CCbug() removed, code inlined. 

TK22Apr01 slufactor.cc
        Unesseccary cast to CLUFactor* for this removed.

TK22Apr01 dataarray.hh soplex.hh spxlp.hh spxio.cc
