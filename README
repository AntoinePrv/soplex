	SoPlex --- the Sequential Object-oriented simPlex

1.	Compiling

	Look through the 'Makefile' and change the flags as neccessary for
	your environment. Some samples are given. Please note that
	setting '-DNDEBUG' greatly enhanced the speed of the program, but
	nearly all internal checks are turned off. So if you compile 
	SoPlex for the first time, you should compile without '-DNDEBUG'
	and test if the output is correct.

	The executable can only be built, if TCL has been installed to
	your system. There may occur some problems with your version of
	TCL, that should be solved via the defines 'LONG_TCL_MAIN',
	'TCL_MAIN' and 'RC_FILE_IS_TCL_VARIABLE'. Set 'CPPFLAGS' to 
	'-DTCL_MAIN', if your TCL library contains the function 'main'
	(an appropriate error message will be issued by the linker). If
	an error message occurs for function Tcl_Main, try compiling with
	'-DLONG_TCL_MAIN'. If the compiler complains about the variable
	'tcl_RcFileName' use '-DRC_FILE_IS_TCL_VARIABLE'.
	You may have to include the path to the TCL include files with
	a '-I/usr/include/tcl' or similiar in 'CPPFLAGS'.
	Also the name of the TCL library in 'LDFLAGS' may vary.

2.	Installation

	Installation of SoPlex consists of installing:
	  - the binary
	  - the library
	  - the includes
	  - the html documentation
	  - the hardcopy documentation
	In principle, you may copy all the files where you like, since
	SoPlex does not require any structure. However, the following
	directory is suggested, where ... is an arbitrary path:

	.../soplex            copy '.spxrc' there
	.../soplex/bin        copy 'soplex' there
	.../soplex/lib        copy 'libsoplex.a' there
	.../soplex/include    copy '*.{h,hh}' there
	.../soplex/doc        copy 'doc/*' there
	.../soplex/html       copy 'html/*' there

	Don't forget to set the permissions as desired. If you need to
	keep binaries and libraries for different plattforms and compilers
	(note, name mangling differs between C++ compilers so that different
	libraries will be needed for different compilers!), you should
	use something like .../soplex/bin-<plattform-compiler> and
	.../soplex/lib-<plattform-compiler> instead.


3.	Usage

3.1	Using soplex

	Starting soplex is as simple as typing 'soplex' provided it will
	be found in your path. This will take you to 'SPxTCL' the TCL
	shell provided for SoPlex. 'help' will get you a descriptions
	on the commands available.

	The TCL shell for SoPlex reads the file '.spxrc' before starting.
	It looks for it in (1) the current directory (2) the users home
	director and (3) at the PATH specified by the SPXHOME environment
	variable.

3.2	Using the library

    	An example on how to use the soplex library is provided in the
	file 'example.cc'. It shows how to use the command line parser
	class CmdLine and how to read and solve LPs with SoPlex. 


4.	Documentation

	Documentation for the binary 'soplex' is provided online via
	the 'help' command. Documentation for the class graph of SoPlex
	is provided for both, hardcopy output and online reading. The
	online version can be viewed with a WWW-browser, preferably
	Netscape 2.0 or greater. The hardcopy versions are provided as
	LaTeX, DVI and postscript files (be warned: They sum up to 238
	pages). Both versions can automatically be extracted using DOC++
	from the include files for SoPlex.


5.	Bug report

	If you find any bugs, or LP-files were SoPlex fails to find the
	optimal solution, please report to soplex@zib.de.


6.	Publications

	Any publication for which SoPlex has been used must include an
	aknowledge ment and a reference to the Ph.D. thesis:

	Roland Wunderling,
	"Paralleler und Objekt-orientierter Simplex-Algorithmus",
	ZIB technical report TR 96-09, Berlin 1996
