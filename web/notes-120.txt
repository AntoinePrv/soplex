Notes for SoPlex Release 1.2.0

What's new
----------
 - Big code cleanup (no more warnings, mostly ;-) 
 - All code should now be ANSI C++ (whatever this exactly means) 
   and should compile on most compilers
 - No more TCL, lex, yacc and C
 - New MPS and LPF format loading routines 
 - Everything is contained in the namespace "soplex"
 - Extended HTML documentation now generated with doxygen
 - Extended example (commandline solver) program
 - Testscripts to run the Netlib up and down
 

Remarks
-------
We have tested this version heavily, but not against 1.1.
This means, we know neither if it is slower or faster nor 
if it is more or less stable then 1.1. 

As you can see if you look at the TODO section of the documentation,
there are a lot of things left to do. For this reason and because 
we changed a lot of code we regard this version BETA.
