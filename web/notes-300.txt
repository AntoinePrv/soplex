Notes for SoPlex Release 3.0.0

What's new
----------

 - new scaling implementation: Least squares, (Curtis-Reid scaling); use with "-g5"
 - solution polishing: perform additional primal pivots at optimal basis
   turn on with parameter "int:solution_polishing"
     0 - off
     1 - try to increase number of basic slack vars
     2 - try to decrease number of basic slack vars
 - persistent scaling:
   - keep scaled LP for multiple reoptimizations
   - modifications to LP are correctly transformed
 - decomposition based dual simplex:
   - an experimental version of the a decomposition based approach to avoid degeneracy in the dual simplex method
   - activated by setting the parameter bool:decompositiondualsimplex to true.
     - this sets the basis representation to 'row', the solve mode to 'real', and the algorithm to 'dual'.
   - additional parameters include:
     usecompdual: setting to true using the dual formulation of the complementary problem, default is false.
     explicitviol: setting to true explicitly computes the violation of the reduced problem solution instead of using the
       complementary problem to identify violated rows, default is false.
     decomp_iterlimit: the number of algorithm iterations for the decomposition based simplex.
     decomp_maxaddedrows: the maximum number of rows added to the reduced problem in each algorithm iteration.
     decomp_displayfreq: the frequency of output for the decomposition based simplex.
     decomp_verbosity: the verbosity level of the decomposition based simplex.
 - computing the degeneracy of a basis in each iteration:
   - the parameter computedegen, when set to true will compute the degeneracy of each basis.
 - write dual formulation to file: additional command line option "--writedual" is provided to write the dual formulation
   to a file. When providing this option only the file is output, the problem is not solved.
 - automatically use the row representation for problems with more than 20% more constraints than variables
 - thread-safety by using the storage class specifier thread-local for static variables
