Notes for SoPlex Release 1.4

What's new
----------
 - All unrecoverable errors are now reported via exceptions.
 - Elementary handling of basis files is now possible.
 - Objective limit termination now works.
 - The standard output of SoPlex should be more (human) readable now.
 - The 'main' file is now called soplexmain.cpp.
 - Several bugfixes.
   
For details see the CHANGELOG file.


Remarks
-------

Reading and writing basis files is now possible. The LP-format does
not support ranged rows (nor a mapping of a ranged (in)equality that
has been split into two parts to the original one). For full
compatibility between the basis file and the LP, the LP has to be
available in MPS format.

The interfaces were changed slightly. Check CHANGELOG if you are
missing a method.

A shared library of SoPlex can be built with a makefile similar to
make.linux.x86.gnu.opt-shared in the 'make' directory.
