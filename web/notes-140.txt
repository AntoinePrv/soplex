Notes for SoPlex Release 1.4

What's new
----------
 - All unrecoverable errors are now reported via exceptions.
 - The 'main' file is now called soplexmain.cpp.
 - Elementary handling of basis files is now possible.
 - The standard output of SoPlex should be more (human) readable now.
 - Objective limit termination now works.
 - Several bugs fixes.
   
For details see the CHANGELOG file.


Remarks
-------

Reading and writing basis files is now possible. The LP-format does
not support ranged rows (nor a mapping of a ranged (in)equality that
has been split into two parts to the original one). For full
compatability between the basis file and the LP, the LP has to be
available in MPS format.

The interfaces were changed slightly. Check CHANGELOG if you are
missing a method.

A shared library of SoPlex can be build with a makefile similar to
make.linux.x86.gnu.opt-shared in the 'make' directory.
