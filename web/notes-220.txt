Notes for SoPlex Release 2.2.0

Exact solving capability
------------------------

SoPlex now provides the possibility to compute exact rational solutions.  This
relies on two methods that are interleaved with SoPlex's iterative refinement
scheme:

- a rational LU factorization of the basis matrix after promising refinement
  rounds

- rational reconstruction ("rounding") via continued fraction approximations

This can be activated by parameters.  By default, SoPlex operates as a standard
floating-point LP solver as before.


Further news
------------

- dual steepest edge norms can now be extracted and restored

- thread safety: output stream SPxOut is no longer a global variable

- many performance improvements for iterative refinement and sparse LPs

For details see the CHANGELOG file and the Doxygen documentation.
